# Cache-Simulator-for-L1-L2-Memory-Hierarchy
## Description:
Welcome to the Cache Simulator for Memory Hierarchy repository! This simulator is a tool to help you understand how computer memory hierarchy and caching work, specifically designed for educational purposes. Whether you're a computer science student, an enthusiast, or just curious about how your computer stores and retrieves data, this simulator can provide insights into the inner workings of memory systems.

## What Does This Repository Offer?
**Cache Simulator Code:** The heart of this repository is the C++ code for the cache simulator. It demonstrates the functionality of a memory hierarchy, including two levels of cache (L1 and L2) and the interaction with main memory. The simulator reads a trace file containing memory access patterns (e.g., read and write operations) and simulates cache hits and misses. You can experiment with different cache configurations and memory access patterns.

**Example Trace Files:** To get you started, an example trace file is provided that you can use with the simulator. These trace files mimic real-world memory access patterns and can help you understand how caching affects the performance of memory systems.

**Sample Outputs:** A sample output file is generated by the cache simulator. You can compare your results with these sample outputs to validate your configurations and experiments.

## How to Use the Simulator:
**Clone or Download:** Start by cloning or downloading this repository to your local machine.

**Compile the Code:** Compile the C++ code using your preferred C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

**Run the Simulator:** Execute the compiled code, passing a trace file as input. The simulator will read the trace file and provide information about cache hits, cache misses, and memory accesses **./cachesimulator.out cacheconfig.txt trace.txt**

### Sample Input and Output: 
**Input:** "R 0xad23f21c" (Trace.txt)
This is a Read instruction ("R"). A Write Instruction is Prefixed with ("W"). The Second part is the Address the CPU is passing with the instruction. The CPU can either request some data to read from an address or Write New data to an address. The 32-bit Hexcode Denotes the Address

**Output:** "2 1 5" (trace.txt.out)
This means the CPU tried to Read from L1 but missed as there was no corresponding Tag to the address. However, there was a HIT in L2 and eviction from both L1 and L2 was required to place the newly Read Data - (215). The image below shows different possibilities.

**Experiment:** Modify the cache configurations in the code, try different trace files, and observe how cache parameters impact system performance. Use the sample output files as references.
